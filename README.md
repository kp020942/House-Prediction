# House Prices Prediction - Advanced Regression Techniques

In this project, we are going to predict the price of a house using its 80 features.
To get more accuracy, we trained all top supervised regression algorithms but you can try out a few of them which are always popular. After training all algorithms, we found that SVR and XGBoost regressor have given high accuracy than remain but we have chosen SVR.
